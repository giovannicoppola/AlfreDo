<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>

		3. All tasks (default: `!3`)
		4. New task (default: `!!!`)

	- open task in Todoist app, or website


<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>

## Searching your tasks üîç
- launch with keyword or custom hotkey. You can start from 1) tasks due today, 2) tasks overdue, or 3) all tasks
![](images/demo.png)
- Use multiple strings, or label/projects to refine search. Use `@` to enter one or more labels, `#` to enter a project/section. 
- Once a task is selected, you can do one of three things: 
	- `enter` ‚Ü©Ô∏è will open the task on [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (default) or in the Todoist app, based on user preference set in `Configure Workflow`
	- `shift-enter` ‚áß‚Ü©Ô∏è will complete the task
	- `ctrl-enter` ^‚Ü©Ô∏è will open a menu to reschedule the task. Choose one of the options, or enter a date in international format, with (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`) of without (`YYYY-MM-DD`) time, or enter a number of days. You can also use `w` or `m` after the number to enter weeks and months, respectively (e.g. `10w` will reschedule in 10 weeks)
	- Time (in 24h format) can be added after these shortcuts as well (e.g. `7w13:13`).

## Creating new tasks ‚≠ê
- launch with keyword (default: `!!!`) or hotkey. Use `@` to enter one or more labels (new ones can be created here), `#` to enter a project/section (`Inbox` will be used if none entered), `due:` to enter a due date, `p[1-4]` to enter a priority. As in reschedule, choose one of the options, or enter a date in international format, with (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`) of without (`YYYY-MM-DD`) time, or enter a number of days. You can also use `w` or `m` after the number to enter weeks and months, respectively (e.g. `10w` will set a due date in 10 weeks). Time (in 24h format) can be added after these shortcuts as well (e.g. `7w13:13`).
- Universal Action: new tasks can be created by selecting text in any app, then launching Universal Actions and selecting `Create a new Todoist task`.

## Database refresh üîÑ
- will occur according to the rate in days set in `AlfreDo` preferences, after a task is created, completed, or rescheduled, or...
	- `todoist::refresh` to force database refresh
